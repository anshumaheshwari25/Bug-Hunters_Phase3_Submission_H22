# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm i -f`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The same way you can Do with the node server
First go to the Healthcare_node folder and than 
### `npm i -f`
### `npm start`
and now thus a server will be start at port 9999

Thirdly for running the python files first you need to pip the requirements by doing
### `pip install -r requirements.txt`
thus all the necessary python librabry will be installed in your local computer
That's all you are Good to go
Thanks
