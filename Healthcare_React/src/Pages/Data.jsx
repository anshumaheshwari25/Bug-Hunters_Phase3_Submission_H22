    <div className='d-flex flex-row'>Data Driven Decision Making
      Here in the Data Driven Decision making we have large number of datasets and using that model we need to predict/generate by using that datasets
      so now our basic goals is to generate that datasets and constatly train our model
      so 3Dm process can be applied at various domains and healthcare is one of them
      Now to collect data of users forst we need to convert the earlier prescribtions and test samples to digital data after analyszing the other task is to taking the live data of each and every prescribed
      For this we suggest one Idea like Aadhar we can create the uniqueId of each and evry patient and thus one account is created and all the basic information of user will be stored
      now whenevr any patient visit the doctor the doctor needs to put the evry prescription in the application and thus we have robust infrastrucure of this and the huge databse
      now this has many advantages because in today's world data is king so first the government can use this data for their welfare schmes and in case on national health emergency this
      data can be usefull for data analysis we can genrate so many accurate models using this and thus it will further increase our health infrastructure
      secondly we can use it to analysis the patient health in transparent manner because as everything is over the app whenver the patient visits the doctore he cann get to know at exactly
      which point of time what prescribtion is given if any doctore suggsts wrong information than necessary action can be taken
      now if any doctor try to hide the data so for that AI/ML model will be very helpfull because once the account is created than model constatly trues to make a boundry line
      now a line that follows the constant graph can be taken OK but major shift occurs in it means something is missing and we can EASily backtrack it and find major issues
      now if we have large enough data of users than we can easliy predict the infuture occurs and soomething bad is going to happen so we can easily notify the users so necessary action
      can be taken and a tragedy can be avoided
      But now soo much data can invite hackers so we need to have secured infrasture for it like we can implement blochains where data in stored in decentralized way so if any node
      gets distrupted we can easily come to know and thus it can be recoverd in a quick time..
      so here as we see data is important but efficient and accurate model is more important because one wrong information can cause heavy loss
      we can use Reinforcement learning but first the machine need to be train from it's own error this takes too much time
      so one possible way to use Neural Networks where future trends,classification or regression decision making can be easily implemented
